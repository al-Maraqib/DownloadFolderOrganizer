# DownloadFolderOrganizer
A simple way to keep my folder from getting cluttered. Not intended for any major usage, it's instead a quick, moderately practical way for me to relearn Python and get some Github practice.

Do not expect any particularly substantial programming here, but feel free to take this project if you so desire and modify it to suit yourself.
